""" AVL Tree

Devised by Adelson-Velsky and Landis
â€¢ An AVL tree is a Binary Search Tree in which the following property holds:

    AVL property: -1 <= b(n) <= 1 for all nodes n

Balance Factor
Balace Factor b(n) = height(n.right) - height(n.left).

The height of the binary tree is considered to be the longest path starting from the root node to any leaf node in the binary tree.

height(null) = -1
height(n) = 1 + max(height(n.left), height(n.right)

Depth of a node:
    The path starting from the root node to that node.
